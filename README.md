# directory_arranger
directory arranger program for windows that doesn't work :'v
I first made the Java version, but it just did not work. The method to move files did not move the files.
So I made the C++ version, but it... DID NOT WORK! After two <b>whole</b> days of debugging, the function that moves the file (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365239(v=vs.85).aspx) just won't work for me. And what is worst, no error is returned. To be honest, the C++ version was hell. I  missed Java's type safety.
So... You know, coming soon, the C# version.
